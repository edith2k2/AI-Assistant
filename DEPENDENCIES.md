# Dependencies

## Installation

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting Dependencies

If you encounter any dependency-related errors with `requirements.txt`, you can use the comprehensive dependencies list:
```bash
pip install -r all_requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: `all_requirements.txt` contains all packages from the development environment, including additional dependencies. Use this only if you face issues with the minimal `requirements.txt`.
